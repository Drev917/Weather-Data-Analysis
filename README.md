# Weather Data Analysis and Visualization

I used NumPy and Pandas libraries to analyze and sort overall weather correlation to sales revenue.

The dataset had no headers, so I added headers `Temperature`, `Rain`, and `Sales`.

I also looked at relationships between the weather as a binary indicator (rain or not) and sales vs weather given the attached csv file.

I then used seaborn to visualize the data commonality for easy dissemination.
